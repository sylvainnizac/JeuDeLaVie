==========

My first C project, a little over commented but these were really helpfull.
The aim of the project was to start understanding C.
Still in improvement.
bfore
before compiling be sure to have in the directory the libctoolbox.so file, see the toolbox repository.
And don't forget to export the new env variable: esx
port Ld_LiIBRARY_PATH=path/to/program/and/lib
